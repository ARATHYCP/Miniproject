# Handwritten Character Recognition with Neural Network

In this machine learning project, I will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This is going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

# Required frameworks are:-

(1) Numpy (version 1.16.5)

(2) cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)

(3) Keras (version 2.3.1)

(4) Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)

(5) Matplotlib (version 3.1.1)

(6) Pandas (version 0.25.1)
