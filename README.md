# Handwritten Character Recognition with Neural Network

In this machine learning project, I will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This is going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

*Required frameworks are:

Numpy (version 1.16.5)
cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
Keras (version 2.3.1)
Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
Matplotlib (version 3.1.1)
Pandas (version 0.25.1)
